# Cryptocurrencies

As part of this analysis different sorts of cryptocurrecies were examined.  As part of the analysis PCA and K-means were used as the two primary approaches to gaining sense of the data.  These approaches are unsupervised machine learning techniques and for this analysis unsupervised learning was the method that made the most sense given the data being used.  In unsupervised learning the algorithm takes in data and uses it to learn with no output or result that is known.  The algorithm is trying to predict what the outcome might be but that outcome is not known beforehand.

In the case of cryptocurrency, it may not be known what the trading price of the coins will be but there is data to tell us what it has traded at in the past.  In addition to what the price of a cryptocurrency might be there is also wanting to look at the supply of a given currency and how much has been mined or will be mined.  Since the supply of cryptocurrencies is changing given how much is mined, the exact outcome of how much is not truly known because the supply is changing.  Also crypto is an area where there is lots of room for growth in terms of the profitability that can be made on mining a particular currency.
